# CRunner

CRunner is a command for compiling, running and testing C/C++ and Go files. For the quick running of file no need for `gcc file.c` and then `./a.out`. Just `cr` is enough for the last modified file.c. Everything is explained in the help text, I hope...

git clone https://github.com/Slate5/CRunner.git
make -f CRunner/Makefile
```

## Use

Check out help text:\
